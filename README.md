# Introduction
Over the course of this project, I implemented five primary behaviors on a Neato robot platform: teleoperation, driving in a square, wall following, person following, and obstacle avoidance. The final behavior was a finite state controller to switch between two behaviors (wall following and person following).

# Reflection
I chose to work alone so that I could work on every aspect of this project and build an intuition for robot programming. While I do think I gained what I wanted from the experience, completing the entire project by myself - especially with a lack of experience - took much longer than the project was supposed to.
The biggest hurdle I had to overcome to complete this project was my lack of experience with python and ROS. Upon reflection, I think I am much more comfortable with the basics of programming now, though there are a lot of advanced techniques I would like to learn to make my code better. I am aware that a lot of my code can be much more efficiently programmed than it is - unfortunately, I ran out of time to do so.
